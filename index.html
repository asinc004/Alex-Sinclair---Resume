        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Alex Sinclair, and I am currently working on getting my BA in Spanish with a concentration in Spanish Linguistics. I am studying at the University of California, Riverside and I have just started my third year of attendance at the university. I aspire to become a foreign language instructor for high school students to utilize my professional and personal experiences to better encourage students to learn a new language. I am also hoping to take coding classes in the near future because I have a great interest in all aspects of coding.<br>
        
        <br>

       I grew up living in Fontana, CA which is about 30 minutes away from U.C. Riverside. I am the youngest in a family of five children and a daughter, to an immigrant mother. I aspire to be successful within my career in order to take care of my parents so that they no longer have to work. I also hope to one day figure out how to fix my mother’s legal status within this country. While these are some goals that I have, there are also other things that interest me. Some of my interests have included basketball and art. Recently I have also enjoyed spending my free time reading and learning more about different coding courses that I would be able to take outside of school. I learned how to play basketball in 8th grade and through this experience I have been able to hone in on problem solving abilities that I’ve utilized everyday while also knowing how to work with different personalities and people.<br><br>

        The experience that I have working is only limited to that of working in the food service industry. Working at a Denny’s Diner in Corona one of the main things that is required is the ability to speak Spanish. Much of the clientele that come to this particular restaurant speak spanish, and always find immense joy when I can speak the same language they do. Having worked in this industry for two years now, I have learned much of what it takes to properly serve food to customers and how to fix any mistake that were to occur in order to keep customers satisfied and willing to return to the establishment. I have also been able to learn the inner workings of how to place food orders for the week, compare the sales from previous week and years, And how to use this information in order to not run out of product when holidays and the busy season comes every fall and winter. While I’m not entirely knowledgeable about all the needed math and numbers that it takes to run a business I know quite a bit about how to converse and make relations with customers. Through these interactions with all the customers, I have found motivation to pursue an education of learning everything there is to know about the Spanish language. I have learned how it takes to be fully dedicated to a cause and how to stay motivated to accomplish an attainable goal.
